Hello Everyone, 
Below is a list of some Git commands I am practising on : 
$ git init 
  Initialize a new git directory 
$ git status 
  shows the current status of the repository 
$ git add < filename> or <.>
  adds some content to your file in the repository
$ git commit -m " some comments.." 
  records the changes to the repository and the comments indicate what actually changed 
$ git log 
  shows all the commits made ( even by other people working on the same repository)
$ git log -p 
  shows what is inside those commits 
$ git push 
  upload the changes made in the content of the local repository to the remote repository 
$ git pull 
  make a request if your changes in the local repository can be accepted/ approved in the remote repository
$ git clone 
  download an existing remote repository in to your repository  
$ git branch 
  shows you the list of branches in the repository
